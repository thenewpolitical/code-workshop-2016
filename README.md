# Welcome!
This is a place for all of you to come and learn the joys of web development!

## ... But where am I?
Glad you asked; You are on github.com! ( ooo, AAAH )
I know you have no idea what that means but for coders this wonderful place is where dreams come true.

This site is home to a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control "Wikipedia"). Simply put it is a system that allows someone, or many someones, to view, edit, save and revert changes to a project without fear of loosing things.

### This is great for many reasons:

1. I can give tasks here to complete that are always available to you
2. Any changes you make can be saved and shared with everyone else
  * these changes wont change the files I give you
  * Any changes made can be reverted back other changes you have made or even all the way back to my original
3. anywhere you have u=internet you can upload files here and they will be saved forever but you dont have to use this site to edit, you can write whatever you want on your computer, with or without internet and them upload the changes later.

## Okay, but how?
Below is a list of the sections of this page each with skills I plan to help you learn. First we need an understanding of the site and navigation of the exercises to come.
